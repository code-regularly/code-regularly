#### 05. Blockchain Consultant & Generative AI Adviser

_‚Ä¢ &nbsp; Working @ Present &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ &nbsp; Permanent &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ &nbsp; Part-time &nbsp; ‚Ä¢ &nbsp; Remote_

üëâ _I advised my employer on integrating permissionless public blockchains and cloud-based permissioned BaaS with their client-facing software product modules. I was the key person on the team, explaining to the execuives and the directors how blockchains would enable zero-knowledge ID management for employees, more private IAM, impact supply chains, affect audits trails, bring about internal and external data transparency ‚Äî and more._

üëâ _I provided consultancy to the company on integrating generative AI with their client-facing software product. My submitted works included advice on LLM selection based on product requirements, agentic army development with Mode-Context-Provider (MCP) architecture, model optimisations via RAG and LRA techniques, outlining hardhware requirements ‚Äî and much more. This was perhaps the most exciting things I worked on during my stay here._
